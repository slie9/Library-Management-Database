# Library-Management-Database
SQL Database Project Creating a Library Management System

The database is for a library's catalog of books, noting which ones are available and information about the book, such as:​

- Author​
- Publisher​
- Number of copies available​
- Title ​
- ISBN​
- Genre ​
- Section in the library​
- Borrowed date and return date​

This database is available to the librarians, assistant librarians, and library members. ​

Each has their own ID number (an EMPID and a MemberID, respectively).​

Members have an account with their date of birth, username, and password.​

Workers at the library have a libraryID, JobID, and JobType.​
