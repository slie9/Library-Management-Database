# Library-Management-Database
SQL Database Project Creating a Library Management System

The project involves the creation of a Library Management System using a SQL database. The system aims to maintain a comprehensive catalog of books available in the library, including their authors, publishers, number of copies available, titles, ISBNs, genres, and sections in the library. Additionally, the system tracks the borrowed date and return date of books.

The database can be accessed by librarians, assistant librarians, and library members, each with their unique ID numbers (EMPID and MemberID). Library members have an account that includes their date of birth, username, and password. Workers at the library also have a libraryID, JobID, and JobType recorded in the system.
